# DonationPalProject

DonationPal is a MERN stack application in multiple sprints. 
The first two sprints will involved scaffold out the front end (React) and back end (Node.js/Express) of the application. 
The starter data was stored in three MongoDB collections: campaigns, donations, and users.
The project has 2 majors APIs. There is an API endpoint for campaigns returns JSON of all campaigns in database. 
There is another API endpoint for campaign details returns JSON of a single campaign and a nested JSON dictionary 
of all donations for that campaign. On the other hand, the React front end application retrieved the data from these APIs.
There is a homepage that displays the different campaigns.
By clicking on a campaign's "details" link, a new page is opened to shows the users the details of that specific campaign.
